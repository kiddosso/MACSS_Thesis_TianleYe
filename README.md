## Abstract

Concerns have been raised regarding the potential fragmentation and weakening histori-
cal continuity within sociology during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This study
investigates the evolution of sociological discourse by using text embedding models. By
turning paper documents into high-dimensional embeddings, this research analyzes eight
decades of papers (1940-2020) from the American Sociological Review (ASR) and the Ameri-
can Journal of Sociology (AJS). Findings indicate that while semantic meanings of sociology
gradually and steadily shift away from its past, the studies in the twenty-first century have
only tenuous semantic relationships with those in the 1940s and 1950s. Moreover, the de-
velopment of sociology appears to follow the shape of multiple ongoing subprocesses rather
than a series of clearly defined distinct periods. This research contributes to understanding
the semantic shift of publications in social sciences.
